# Code of Conduct

## CODE_OF_CONDUCT_VERSION 1.0

We are committed to maintaining a welcoming and inclusive community for everyone. All interactions within this project, including participation in discussions, code contributions, and issue reporting, are governed by this code of conduct.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, particularly in the context of this complex technical migration from Apache Airflow 1.10.15 to Airflow 2.X.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

*   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people, recognizing the technical challenges this migration presents
*   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences, especially when discussing migration approaches
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback on migration code and implementation strategies
*   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
*   Focusing on what is best for the overall community and the successful migration of the platform
*   Collaborating effectively across teams (development, DevOps, QA, and business stakeholders)
*   Providing detailed, constructive feedback during code reviews and technical discussions
*   Sharing knowledge about Airflow 2.X features and best practices

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances of any kind
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
*   Blaming team members for migration challenges without offering constructive solutions
*   Deliberately introducing breaking changes without proper testing or documentation
*   Circumventing the established approval workflow for deployments
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers and migration leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Project leadership has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including project repositories, DAG code, infrastructure configuration, documentation, and communication channels. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project leadership team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Specific enforcement policies may be detailed separately.

Enforcement actions include:

1.  **Correction**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.
2.  **Warning**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
3.  **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
4.  **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban from any sort of interaction within the project community.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project team at conduct@example.com. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

*   Your contact information
*   Names (real, usernames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
*   Description of the behavior and the context
*   Any relevant documentation, screenshots, or other evidence
*   Any additional information that may be helpful

For security vulnerabilities, please contact the security team at security@example.com instead of using the Code of Conduct reporting process. Include detailed information about the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any potential impact if known. The security team will respond within 48 hours and work with you to address the issue appropriately.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

Given the technical nature of migrating from Airflow 1.10.15 to Airflow 2.X on Cloud Composer, we emphasize these additional guidelines:

*   Practice patience with team members who are learning new Airflow 2.X concepts
*   Document your migration approaches thoroughly for others to learn from
*   Provide concrete examples when suggesting alternative approaches
*   Follow the established multi-stage approval process for all production changes
*   Prioritize maintainability and readability in migrated code
*   Raise concerns about migration approaches constructively with potential solutions
*   Share knowledge about deprecations and breaking changes proactively
*   Respect the balance between migration velocity and stability/quality

Note: For contributing code, please also refer to our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) which provide specific technical guidance on the contribution workflow.
