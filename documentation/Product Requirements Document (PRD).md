# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Purpose

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) specifies the requirements for migrating an existing Apache Airflow 1.10.15 codebase from Cloud Composer 1 to Cloud Composer 2 with Airflow 2.X. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for:

- Development teams executing the migration
- DevOps engineers implementing CI/CD pipelines
- QA teams validating the migration
- Project stakeholders and approvers
- System architects reviewing the technical approach

## 1.2 Scope

The scope of this migration project encompasses:

### 1.2.1 In Scope
- Migration of existing DAG files from Composer 1 (Airflow 1.10.15) to Composer 2 (Airflow 2.X)
- Implementation of CI/CD pipeline for DAG deployment to GCP GCS buckets
- Creation of automated test cases for DAG validation
- Dependency version updates and compatibility adjustments
- Documentation updates reflecting Airflow 2.X syntax and features

### 1.2.2 Out of Scope
- Addition of new DAG functionality or features
- Changes to existing business logic
- Modifications to external systems or dependencies
- Infrastructure changes beyond Composer version upgrade
- Changes to existing data pipelines' business outcomes

# 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

## 2.1 Product Perspective
The Airflow migration project exists within Google Cloud Platform's managed Apache Airflow service ecosystem, transitioning from Cloud Composer 1 to Cloud Composer 2. This migration represents a version upgrade rather than a system change, maintaining integration with existing GCP services and external dependencies while leveraging improved infrastructure and features of Composer 2.

## 2.2 Product Functions
- DAG execution and scheduling using Apache Airflow 2.X runtime
- Automated deployment of DAGs through GCP Cloud Storage buckets
- Version control and code review processes through Git-based workflows
- Automated testing and validation of DAG configurations
- Multi-environment (DEV/QA/PROD) deployment management
- Role-based access control for deployment approvals
- Backward compatibility with existing data pipeline integrations

## 2.3 User Characteristics

|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Development Team | Advanced | DAG development, code migration, unit testing |
| DevOps Engineers | Expert | CI/CD pipeline management, deployment automation |
| QA Engineers | Intermediate | Test execution, validation, regression testing |
| System Architects | Expert | Technical design review, approval of changes |
| CAB Members | Intermediate | Production deployment approval |
| Stakeholders | Basic | Business requirement validation, final approval |

## 2.4 Constraints
- Must maintain existing DAG naming conventions and structure
- Zero downtime requirement for production migration
- Compliance with GCP security and access control policies
- Limited to Airflow 2.X compatible operators and features
- Must preserve existing task dependencies and scheduling patterns
- Resource limitations of Cloud Composer 2 environment
- Migration must be completed within existing infrastructure budget

## 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
### Assumptions
- Existing DAGs are functionally correct and production-validated
- Source control access and permissions are properly configured
- Development team has necessary GCP access and permissions
- Current infrastructure can support parallel environments during migration

### Dependencies
- Access to GCP Cloud Composer 2 service
- GitHub or similar version control system
- CI/CD platform compatibility with GCP services
- Availability of test environments
- External system APIs and connections remain stable
- Support from GCP for Composer 2 service
