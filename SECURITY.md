# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security policy for the Cloud Composer 2 migration project, which involves transitioning from Apache Airflow 1.10.15 on Cloud Composer 1 to Airflow 2.X on Cloud Composer 2. The policy covers vulnerability reporting procedures, authentication and authorization controls, data security measures, monitoring practices, and compliance standards.

The security policy aims to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of all components within the Cloud Composer 2 environment, including DAG code, metadata, credentials, and runtime data.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Cloud Composer 2 with Airflow 2.X | ✅ | Active development and security updates |
| Cloud Composer 1 with Airflow 1.10.15 | ❌ | Deprecated, no security updates |

Only Cloud Composer 2 with Airflow 2.X is officially supported with security updates. Cloud Composer 1 with Airflow 1.10.15 is considered deprecated and will not receive security updates. Users are strongly encouraged to migrate to Cloud Composer 2 to ensure continued security support.

We adhere to a responsible disclosure policy and request that vulnerabilities not be disclosed publicly until we've had an opportunity to address them.

## Authentication Methods

The Cloud Composer 2 environment supports the following authentication methods:

| Method | Use Case | Implementation |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Google SSO | User authentication | Cloud Identity integration with support for MFA |
| Service Accounts | Automated processes | GCP IAM service accounts with limited privileges |
| API Keys | External integrations | Secret Manager stored keys with automatic rotation |
| OAuth 2.0 | Third-party access | Cloud Identity OAuth with scoped permissions |

### Best Practices

- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user accounts
- Implement the principle of least privilege for service accounts
- Regularly rotate API keys (automated where possible)
- Audit authentication logs at least weekly
- Use Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for additional protection

## Authorization Controls

Access to the Cloud Composer 2 environment is controlled through a role-based access control (RBAC) system with the following roles:

| Role | Permissions | Access Level |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Viewer | Read-only access to DAGs and logs | Basic |
| Editor | DAG deployment to DEV/QA, variable management | Intermediate |
| Admin | Environment configuration, user management | Advanced |
| Security Admin | Security policy management, audit logs | Highest |

### Access Management Procedures

1. Access requests must be submitted through the official request system
2. All access requires approval from the resource owner
3. Access is granted based on the principle of least privilege
4. Access rights are reviewed monthly
5. Privileged access (Admin, Security Admin) requires additional approval and is subject to more frequent review

## Data Security

The following data protection measures are implemented for different types of data:

| Data Type | Protection Method | Encryption Standard |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| DAG Code | GCS Object Encryption | AES-256 |
| Credentials | Secret Manager | Cloud KMS |
| Connection Info | Encrypted Storage | AES-256 |
| Task Data | In-transit Encryption | TLS 1.3 |
| Metadata | Database Encryption | Cloud SQL TDE |

### Encryption Key Management

- Cloud KMS is used for cryptographic key management
- Keys are rotated automatically according to the defined schedule
- Access to encryption keys is strictly controlled and audited
- Backup keys are securely stored with disaster recovery procedures in place

## Data Classification

Data in the Cloud Composer 2 environment is classified according to the following system:

| Classification | Description | Security Controls |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Public | Non-sensitive DAG metadata | Basic access controls |
| Internal | Business logic, configurations | Role-based access |
| Confidential | Credentials, connection strings | Encryption + access controls |
| Restricted | Security configurations | Strict access + audit logging |

### Data Handling Requirements

- **Public**: May be freely shared within the organization
- **Internal**: Sharing restricted to project team members
- **Confidential**: Access on a need-to-know basis, subject to approval
- **Restricted**: Highest level of protection, strictly limited access with full audit trail

## Security Monitoring

The following security monitoring activities are performed at regular intervals:

| Component | Implementation | Frequency |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Vulnerability Scanning | Cloud Security Scanner | Daily |
| Dependency Checks | Automated security updates | Weekly |
| Access Reviews | IAM policy validation | Monthly |
| Security Audits | Comprehensive review | Quarterly |
| Penetration Testing | Third-party assessment | Annually |

### Monitoring Tools

- Cloud Monitoring for performance and availability metrics
- Cloud Audit Logs for comprehensive activity logging
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration
- Real-time alerting for security-related events
- Custom dashboard for security posture visualization

## Incident Response

The incident response protocol consists of the following phases:

| Phase | Actions | Responsibility |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Detection | Automated alerts, monitoring | Security Team |
| Analysis | Impact assessment, classification | Security + DevOps |
| Containment | Access restriction, isolation | DevOps Team |
| Eradication | Vulnerability patching | Development Team |
| Recovery | Service restoration | Operations Team |
| Post-Incident | Review and documentation | All Teams |

### Communication Protocol

1. Initial alert to Security Team via automated systems
2. Incident confirmation and escalation to appropriate teams
3. Regular status updates to stakeholders
